                                <h4>NEEDS ASSESSMENT</h4>
                                <p>The field of human sexuality places a strong emphasis on therapy and research.
                                    Research confirms that education plays an important part in the prevention of
                                    HIV/AIDS and teen pregnancy. The lack of public sexual health education in the USA
                                    becomes strongly apparent by looking at international health statistics.</p>
                                <p>American sexual health educators can learn from how other cultures successfully deal
                                    with the public education of human sexuality issues.</p>
                                <h4 id="verbage">ABOUT THE PROGRAM</h4>
                                <p>Public health is the practice of preventing disease and promoting good health within
                                    groups of people from small communities to large countries.<br>
                                    Public service announcements (PSAs) and commercials can be some of the most profound
                                    and powerful TV advertising for spreading public health information. They deal with
                                    life-and-death issues and urge us to think about <em>people</em>. They educate to
                                    change our world.<br>
                                    This online course is designed to give participants an opportunity to examine public
                                    health commercial messages and PSAs from many cultures. The messages will cover
                                    various issues in sexual health including language; nudity; sexual orientation;
                                    HIV/AIDS; STIs; condom use; and teen pregnancy. Participants will view twenty-nine
                                    (33) commercials/PSAs from twenty-three (24) countries and contrast and compare the
                                    HIV and teen pregnancy rates per capita in those countries.</p>

                                <h4>LEARNING OBJECTIVES </h4>
